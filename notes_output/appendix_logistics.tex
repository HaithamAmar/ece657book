\section{Course Logistics}\label{app:course_logistics}

This appendix consolidates administrative information that previously appeared in scattered subsections of \Cref{chap:intro}. It is intended to remain stable across offerings and can be skimmed or skipped by readers focused purely on the technical material.

\subsection*{Materials}
This book is self-contained. It does not rely on external companion resources (such as code bundles, figure packs, or solution sets). When the book is used in a course offering, offering-specific documents (syllabus, deadlines, problem sets) are distributed through the local course channel and may change from term to term.

\subsection*{Communication}
Questions and feedback can be handled via email or a forum if one is announced. Office hours, if any, will be communicated alongside the course materials.

\subsection*{Assessment Overview}
Assignments (individual or groups up to three), examinations (if applicable), and self-check exercises interleaved with chapters. Exact dates and policies depend on the offering and will be communicated with the course materials.

\subsection*{Policies}
Submission windows, late policies, and academic integrity guidelines are offering-specific and should be consulted in the local course documentation.

\subsection{Using this book in ECE~657}\label{app:ece657_using_this_book}
When this book is used in ECE~657 at the University of Waterloo, the following apply:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Communication/support:} Course announcements (including clarifications and errata relevant to an offering) are distributed through the course channel; an official forum or mailing list may be announced for Q\&A. Office hours (if any) are posted with the term schedule.
    \item \textbf{Assessment structure:} Problem sets (solo or teams of up to three), quizzes, and two term exams are typical. Weighting and deadlines are confirmed in the term syllabus; use the most recent syllabus if numbers differ from prior offerings.
    \item \textbf{Pacing:} Condensed offerings do not include a formal reading week; exam weeks typically suppress new material. Follow the posted weekly schedule in the syllabus.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility:} Students requiring accommodations should contact AccessAbility Services and notify the instructor early so quiz/exam windows and deadlines can be adjusted. Captions and alternative formats are provided on request when videos accompany the course materials.
    \item \textbf{Integrity:} Follow the University of Waterloo Academic Integrity policy. Credit collaborators appropriately and avoid sharing solutions outside approved groups.
\end{itemize}
