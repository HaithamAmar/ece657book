# LLM Review Comparison (2026-02-12)

## Reviewers compared

- Technical: `notes_output/review/report_llm_technical_20260212.md`
- Editorial: `notes_output/review/report_llm_editorial_20260212.md`

## Overlap (both flagged)

1. Final proof polish is still needed.
   - Technical: recommends a stricter warning-free pass and example verification audit.
   - Editorial: recommends a camera-ready punctuation/spacing pass and cadence cleanup.

## Differences (unique emphases)

- Technical reviewer focuses on correctness risk from unverified worked examples; asks for an explicit verification checklist.
- Editorial reviewer focuses on reader fatigue from templated opening boxes and recommends more varied opening rhythms.

## Suggested next actions (combined)

1. Run a formal example integrity audit and record results in a checklist file.
2. Run a camera-ready prose pass for punctuation/spacing across chapters.
3. Consider a minimal adjustment to opening-box density in Part V if it can be done within the chapter template rules.
