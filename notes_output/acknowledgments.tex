\noindent
This book grew out of teaching and revising the ECE~657 material over multiple
offerings. I am grateful to the students whose questions and feedback repeatedly
exposed where explanations were brittle and where the narrative needed better
bridges between intuition, math, and practice.

\medskip
\noindent
I also thank colleagues who shared perspectives on how these topics fit together
as an engineering discipline rather than as isolated techniques. Any remaining
errors and omissions are my responsibility.
