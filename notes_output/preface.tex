\section*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}
Over time, through teaching courses that engage artificial intelligence both directly---through machine learning and neural networks---and indirectly, at the level of data collection and system design, a recurring gap became apparent. While the literature offers many excellent treatments of individual techniques, it rarely provides a coherent path that guides students from the foundational notions of intelligence to the most advanced models used today. What is often missing is a unified narrative that connects intuition, mathematical formulation, and practical deployment across the diverse tools that constitute intelligent systems.

Courses in machine learning tend to emphasize neural networks and deep learning; others focus on optimization and operations research, from classical search strategies to genetic algorithms. Each approach is valuable, yet time constraints and disciplinary boundaries often force a narrowing of scope, sacrificing breadth for depth or vice versa. In one course in particular, a broader framework emerged---one that treated these methods not as isolated topics, but as complementary responses to recurring modeling challenges. That framework, though not originally mine, proved invaluable: it allowed students to situate linear regression, neural networks, transformers, fuzzy inference systems, and evolutionary algorithms within a single, coherent perspective on intelligent system design. This book is an attempt to make that perspective explicit and durable.

This book has evolved into a concise graduate companion that blends the original chapter voice of
ECE~657 with laboratory-style checklists and reflective prompts. The chapters move from
supervised learning foundations to fuzzy logic and evolutionary computing, mirroring the
trajectory of the original course material while adding connective tissue so that a reader can revisit the material
years later without hunting for missing context.

\subsection*{Origins in ECE 657}
In 2019, I was asked to teach ECE~657 at the University of Waterloo. At the time, the course leaned heavily toward soft computing, and fuzzy inference systems had constituted a large portion of the material in earlier offerings. Prof.~Karray, who built the course, felt it was time to broaden its scope beyond that single paradigm, and he was generous enough to let me reshape the arc of the course.

Over the following years, I came to view fuzzy inference systems as one important piece in a larger mosaic rather than the organizing principle. I iterated on the syllabus---moving topics, adding and removing chapters, and tightening mathematical through-lines---toward a narrative that is coherent, broad in coverage, and implementable by an engineer.

As of this writing, the field is in the era of large language models, and this book covers them (see \Cref{chap:nlp,chap:transformers}). But it also emphasizes other ideas and toolkits that may underwrite future breakthroughs in intelligent systems: careful probabilistic thinking and diagnostics, principled optimization, sequence modeling beyond any single architecture, and hybrid reasoning approaches that have repeatedly re-emerged in new forms.

The material has since been rewritten to stand alone as a book. Any offering-specific details (schedules, grading, local policies) now live in \Cref{app:course_logistics} (especially \emph{Using this book in ECE~657}); readers outside that course can ignore the appendix entirely.

This book prioritizes ideas that survived multiple paradigm shifts. It emphasizes principles that remain useful even as architectures and tooling change.

For a practical reader's guide---roadmap, prerequisites, and suggested reading paths---see the final sections of \Cref{chap:intro}. Notation and reading conventions are collected up front in \emph{Notation and Conventions}.

The result is a self-contained reference for researchers and engineers who want a rigorous but narrative-friendly treatment of neural networks, soft computing, and hybrid reasoning systems.
